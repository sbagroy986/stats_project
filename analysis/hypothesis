H0: Mean of the likability values = 0
H1: Mean != 0(or that users are biased after looking at the artist's name)
H1(alternate): Mean > 0(users are positively biased)
H2(alternate): Mean < 0(users are negatively biased)

Sample_Mu = ..
Sample_Sigma = ..

95% range of Mu = (sample_mu - sample_sigma/root(n)*T[0.05, n-1], sample_mu + sample_sigma/root(n)*T[0.05, n-1])
H0 is rejected if mu = 0 does not lie in this interval
